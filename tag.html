        a) Superscript : This tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal
        line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
        Example :
    <p>Welcome Vaibhav <sup>How</sup> are you ,(a+b)<sup>2</sup></p>

    b) Subscript : this tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and
    is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
    Example :
    <p>Hello Nitin where are <sub>you</sub> going, H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

    c) Strike through :The tag was used in HTML 4 to define strikethrough text. Not Supported in HTML5.
    Example :
    <p>My favorite Game is <del>Volleyball</del> <ins>Badminton</ins>!</p>

    d) Super bold : The tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in
    bold.
    Example :
    <p><strong>This text is very important!</strong></p>

    e) Underline : This tag represents some text that is
    unarticulated and styled differently from normal text,
    such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text.
    The content inside is typically displayed with an underline.
    Eexample :
    <p>I am a <u>Volleyball</u>Player.</p>
    <p>I am good in <u>Volleyball</u> .</p>
    </p>
